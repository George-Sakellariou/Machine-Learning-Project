# ML/DL-Project

This is a Github Repository that contains the files for a machine learning project based on AI Biomedical Engineering.
The main goal of this project is to create and train a Deep Learning AI Inference Model on calculating complex 
cardiovascular measurements and diagnosis of cardiomyopathy. 

The model is based on the Echonet-Dynamic algorithm and for the training a compination of MobilenetV2/MobilenetV3 Neural Network architectures and DeepLabV3/DeepLabV3+ encoders is used to achieve high accuracy results.
